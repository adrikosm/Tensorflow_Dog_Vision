# Tensorflow_Dog_Vision
Simple tensorflow dog image recognition

It was from A kaggle competition

model reached a pretty good accuracy, but could use some more training.

# Summary
The project turns images into tensors then it uses the trained model to predict the dog breed of the image. Then it turns the tensor back into an image and eventually shows the predictions with a simple graph showing the percentage of the predicted values.
