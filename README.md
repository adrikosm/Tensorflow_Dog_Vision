# Project Title
# Tensorflow_Dog_Vision
Simple tensorflow dog image recognition
## Summary
Simple dog breed predictions using tensorflow


## Background
It can predict with a pretty good accuracy a dog breed


## How is it used?

It turns images given into tensors and then it makes prediction on those.
After predicting turns the tensors back to images and prints a graph showing the percentages of the predictions


## Data sources and AI methods
I used tensorflow and tensorflow hub

## Challenges

Making the project into a computer vision

## What next?

Getting the trained model to work real time using computer vision
